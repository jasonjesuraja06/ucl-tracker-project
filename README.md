UEFA Champions League Player Performance Tracker ‚öΩüìä
A full-stack web application designed to track, analyze, and visualize performance statistics for 850+ professional soccer players across 36 teams in the UEFA Champions League. This project features a secure Spring Boot REST API, a dynamic React.js frontend, and a robust PostgreSQL database.

Core Features ‚ú®
üèÜ Player Performance Dashboard: Browse and visualize detailed player statistics including goals, assists, minutes played, expected goals (xG), and expected assisted goals (xAG).

üîç Advanced Filtering & Search: Implement comprehensive filtering by team, nationality, and position. Optimized search queries deliver instant results from a large dataset.

üìä Dynamic Leaderboards: View interactive leaderboards showcasing top players based on key performance indicators like goals, assists, or advanced metrics.

üîê Secure Authentication & Authorization: Integrated Google OAuth2 and OpenID Connect for secure user login. A JWT-based system ensures that API endpoints are protected.

‚öôÔ∏è Role-Based Admin Panel: Admins have exclusive, role-based access to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on player records through a secure interface.

üì± Responsive UI: The frontend is built with React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS, providing a sleek, modern, and fully responsive user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Technical Architecture üõ†Ô∏è
This application is built with a modern, decoupled architecture. The React frontend communicates with a secure, stateless Spring Boot backend via a REST API. Authentication is handled using Google OAuth2, with JWTs used to authorize subsequent API requests.

Frontend (React.js): The client-side application, built with Vite and styled with Tailwind CSS, handles all user interactions and data visualization.

Backend (Spring Boot): The server-side application exposes a REST API for all data operations. It leverages Spring Data JPA for database interaction and Spring Security for robust authentication and authorization.

Database (PostgreSQL): A relational database used to store and manage all player, team, and statistical data efficiently.

Authentication Flow:

User logs in via Google OAuth2.

The Spring Boot backend validates the token and generates a session JWT.

This JWT is sent with every subsequent API request to access protected resources.

Role-based access control restricts sensitive operations (like CRUD) to admin users only.

Prerequisites
Java 21+

Maven 3.8+

Node.js 18+

PostgreSQL 15+

Backend Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/jasonjesuraja06/ucl-tracker-project.git](https://github.com/jasonjesuraja06/ucl-tracker-project.git)
cd ucl-tracker-project/backend

Configure your PostgreSQL database in src/main/resources/application.properties.

Set up your Google OAuth2 credentials.
